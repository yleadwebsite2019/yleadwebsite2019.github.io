							ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
						</div>
						<div class="rationale">
							Given the very rapid rate of technological advancement and advantages of AI, it is inevitable that AI will be increasingly adopted and become commonplace in our daily lives in the future. In order to stay relevant, countries must make use of this technology to unlock its potential in addressing future problems and improving many aspects of life. This ties in with the Y.LEAD theme, Leaders of Tomorrow, as this topic is especially relevant in the lives of today’s youth. It is crucial that they are educated about this topic as it will affect their lives in the near future. As the country’s next batch of leaders, it is important to embrace technology in solving problems. Singapore’s Smart Nation committee has highlighted 5 key domains where artificial intelligence will have significant impact on the citizen and society: transport, home &amp; environment, business &amp; productivity, health &amp;abled ageing and public sector services. Through the panelists’ detailed sharing of AI technologies, for instance the first social robot of NTU, Nadine, capable of expressing emotions and facial recognition, participants will gain insight into how AI would play a major role in building a Smart Nation, while recognizing the need to mitigate the adverse impacts that AI may bring about.

As his company specializes in applied AI solutions, he provided the audience with information regarding the workflow of AI, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, knowledge representation, reasoning and planning. He mentioned various human abilities which AI has been programmed to replicate, and the tasks these abilities could be used to complete. Lastly, he stressed on the advantages and disadvantages of AI, and explained the impact of AI on the world market and industries. The advantages would be efficiency and cost reduction, but disadvantage is that it lacks the ability to judge, and this may result in large scale unemployment.

							SMART LIFESTYLE
						</div>
						<div class="rationale">
							Retail customer experience that is fully augmented by IOT sounds like this: Using a smartphone or wearable device to quickly scan an item and call up product information or reviews. Augmented Reality (AR) Oculus Rifts that provide great try-out experience of products both in store and at home. Contactless checkout by automatic scanning of product as you walk out of store. Innovative features like those above that make use of Internet of Things not only improve customer experience greatly, but also address problems such as shortage of manpower with more automation involved. As many retail companies make changes to their business models that involve more smart technologies, they aim to improve their business productivity, revenue and enhance growth. As participants sit through this talk, not only will they gain more knowledge on the recent happenings of the retail industry, but will also develop an appreciation for the power of innovative technology in solving problems and boosting the retail industry -- which is the essence of the Smart Nation definition.

						<div class="insight-descriptions">
							Mr Roderick Chia first introduced the concept of ‘smart’, which can be perceived at different levels: memory, logic, statistic, strategy (problem solving), wisdom (decision making). While humans definitely possess these traits, with the rapid technological advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), the question is whether AI will eventually obtain all these same strengths as human, catching up or even surpassing human intellect and ability. He believes that ultimately, there are limitations to the intellect of AI. Humans will still have the wisdom and intuition to anticipate problems, make crucial decisions, unlike machines. Thus, we need to adapt our lifestyle to hone our abilities in this aspect, so that we will not compete with AI in a world with limited resources. This can be achieved through a more holistic and comprehensive education, while students like Y.LEADers themselves can learn to be more information literate, ask ‘smart’ questions so as to develop their thinking in order to thrive in the future world.

						<div class="insight-descriptions">
							Mr Alan Yeo mentioned in his sharing about 4 major shifts in consumer trends in the aspect of retail and shopping, namely: The rapid emergence of e-commerce in the past decade; growing customer expectations for products because of a general improvement of retail experience; new overseas opportunities due to rapidly growing economies of South-East Asia and Technology and digitization of retail. As a result, it is imperative for businesses to be innovative and to adapt to the changes posed by the evolving retail landscape. An interesting example of one such innovation is Tesco which invested in virtual stores in various parts of South Korea, whereby walls filled with LCD screens are designed as ‘electronic shelves’ for customers to purchase from. Efficient delivery of products was provided. This risk taken by Tesco successfully increased sales by a huge percentage. Hence, Mr Yeo used this example to highlight that in the current and future world, it is critical to have the courage to acknowledge risks yet take the first step to embrace change, embrace innovation.

							One who makes a ripple impact on the society is influential in his/her own ways. Such influence requires a certain level of leadership, confidence and the conviction for the people. Social entrepreneurs in a profit-driven world allow for love and empathy, addressing society’s most pressing issues, and rejuvenating the call to help the less fortunate. The talk will let the participants understand how to help others, as well as what is the driving force behind such entrepreneurship.

He does this by helping them to reintegrate into society by training them to be hawkers. He utilises his engineering knowledge and skills to come up with new innovations to help the physically disadvantaged cook easily, using simple utensils and implements. For example, a machine was invented to help them cook dumpling noodles more efficiently. Despite making millions of dollars in revenue, he gives most of them away to fund scholarships for the disadvantaged because he believes that they are capable of achievement, if given a chance. He mentioned that to set up a social enterprise, we need to invest our time, love, money, as well as maintain good health in order to open up windows of opportunities to help others. He added that it is definitely not easy to start a social enterprise, so budding enterprisers amongst Y.LEADers must have the commitment and passion for it and be willing to make sacrifices.

							ENVIRONMENT
						</div>
						<div class="rationale">
							The human population is projected to grow up to 9 billion by 2050. Demand for all sorts of resources such as power, plastics and food are increasing drastically, however, resources are limited. Besides, excess resource wastage leads to various environmental problems such as air and water pollution, affecting our quality of life. Hence, this is a pertinent world issue faced by the leaders of tomorrow. In order to mitigate this issue, they would have to initiate global movements, make change and come up with new technologies, innovations and practices that reduce resource wastage. When cities make a change and start to live smart, the world would get closer to being more environmentally friendly and reaching the goal of zero wastage.

						<div class="insight-descriptions">
							Mr Eugene Heng addressed the importance of water conservation in Singapore. Water is a resource we should not take for granted, and this is a stark contrast to the Singaporean mindset. In a country where clean, filtered water is so easily accessible, we may easily overlook or neglect the importance of conserving water. To put things into perspective, only 0.3% of the water on Earth is accessible for human usage. This precious amount has to be further distributed for industrial, consumption and other uses. He stressed that young people must take more ownership and responsibility to reduce water wastage. They should avoid buying superfluous products and practice the 3Rs. Singapore introduced the 4 National Taps; NEWater, desalinated water, local reservoirs and imported water. They each face various problems of differing severity. Reservoir levels are rapidly decreasing. NEWater cannot be consumed in large amounts. As such, Singapore is very dependent on imported water from Malaysia. What can we do as individuals? We should use less water in our daily activities such as brushing and bathing. In Singapore, the top 3 items thrown away are paper (49% not recycled), plastic (93% not recycled) and food (87% not recycled). The impacts of such large amounts of wastage is that it affects aquatic life and the circular food-chain and health issues. By 2060, the oceans will have more plastic than fish.

							Mr Brandon Low
						</div>
						<div class="insight-descriptions">
							Mr Brandon Low kickstarted his presentation by claiming that intention is of utmost importance in helping the environment. Climate change has become a worldwide problem, and Singapore is not spared. There has been an unprecedented increase in greenhouse gas levels and temperatures in the past 100 years. This is important to note as even small changes in temperatures and water levels can result in extreme weather conditions. Singapore’s weather in recent years is characterised by record high temperatures, seasonal dry spells and very intense rainfall. Singapore’s climate has been projected to see an increase in 5oC and a mean sea level increase by 1 meter. This is especially alarming as Singapore is water-bound. To reduce the rate of global warming, citizens must pledge to save the environment. Through actions such as switching off electrical appliances when not in use, refusing plastic bags and straws, turning up air-conditioning temperatures (25oC), minimising paper usage, energy-efficient “ticks” for electrical appliances and recycle. As such, we can all play a crucial role in combating climate change. A small step goes a long way.
